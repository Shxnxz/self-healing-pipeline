"""
Shared helpers for the bronze/silver/gold jobs.

Kept deliberately small: a Spark session builder (Delta + Kafka packages
wired in once) and a guard that waits for an upstream Delta table to exist
before a downstream job tries to stream-read it. On a cold `docker compose
up`, silver_job and gold_job can start before their upstream table has been
created by the first micro-batch of the job before them -- this avoids a
crash-loop while that happens.
